    "> \"The dataset consists of over 1.4 Million musical artists present in the MusicBrainz database — their names, tags, and popularity (listeners/scrobbles), based on data scraped from Last.fm.\"\n",

    "In other words, the dataset combines information from two sources:\n",
    "- **MusicBrainz**: an open, free database of musical metadata\n",
    "- **Last.fm**: a music tracking platform that provides information on user engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "As a side note: **MusicBrainz** contains much more data than what we’re using here — it's a great resource if you're curious about metadata like albums, releases, or recording info.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, **\"scrobbles\"** is Last.fm's term for a user listening to a track. So, artists with many scrobbles are likely to be more popular.\n"

    "## Songs and Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify uses sophisticated analytics to predict how much a user will enjoy a particular song. This is a hard problem for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are **a ton of users**\n",
    "- There are **a ton of songs**\n",
    "- We might need to make predictions for users who haven’t listened to much music (especially not the song or artist in question)\n",
    "- Just listening to a song doesn't always mean the user **likes** it\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for you, I’ve already built some predictions for specific **user–song pairs** using a collaborative filtering model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The main song dataframe is shown below. It includes:\n",
    "- The song title and artist name\n",
    "- A predicted score for **each user**\n",
    "- An **average score** across all users\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: If you see a score of `0.000`, it means the model couldn’t reliably make a prediction — usually because very few users (or none) have ever listened to that song before. These songs are important! They often represent **unfamiliar or lesser-known tracks**, which are great candidates for surfacing new and fresh recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Optional: How Were These Ratings Computed?\n",
    "\n",
    "These scores weren’t produced by Spotify’s proprietary model — instead, I built a simplified system using public data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base dataset came from [this Kaggle source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/spotify-playlists):\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"This dataset is based on the subset of users in the #nowplaying dataset who publish their #nowplaying tweets via Spotify. In principle, the dataset holds users, their playlists, and the tracks contained in these playlists.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the dataset is:\n",
    "- **Biased** toward users who use the “#nowplaying” tweet feature\n",
    "- Reflective of songs that users **added to playlists**, which may indicate preference\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, I fit a collaborative filtering model, performed additional data cleaning, and generated predictions for a large set of users and songs. I then **subsampled** this data down to:\n",
    "- ~20 users\n",
    "- ~20,000 songs\n",
    "As you see below, the first columns correspond to \n",
    " - track_name\n",
    " - artist_name\n",
    " - mbid -- this is the MusicBrains ID for the artist (it's a unique ID used by MusicBrainz)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next set of columns all look like \"user_XXXX\" and correspond to the user ratings for indivdiual users.  The last column gives the average_prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was mostly inspired by the code [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Gurobi/modeling-examples/blob/master/music_recommendation/music_recommendation.ipynb#scrollTo=kztrexxASugU).  If you take a look at that link, you can see how the collaborative filtering was run (for artists, not songs) and you'll actually see a pretty basic model for thinking about how to use this data to make a playlist.  (I expect you guys will develop even more creative/exciting models!)  \n"
